The Last Leaf

In a small apartment in Greenwich Village, two young artists named Sue and Johnsy shared a studio. During a cold November, pneumonia swept through the neighborhood, and Johnsy fell ill.

From her bed, Johnsy could see an ivy vine on the wall of the neighboring building. As her illness progressed, she became convinced that when the last leaf fell from the vine, she would die.

Sue, worried about her friend's state of mind, sought help from their downstairs neighbor, an old painter named Behrman. Despite his gruff exterior, Behrman cared deeply for the young artists.

That night, a terrible storm raged. In the morning, Johnsy insisted on seeing the ivy vine. To her surprise, a single leaf remained, defying the wind and rain.

Day after day, the leaf stayed, giving Johnsy hope. Her health improved, and she eventually recovered.

Only later did Sue learn the truth: during the storm, old Behrman had gone out and painted a perfect leaf on the wall. It was his masterpiece, his final gift. Shortly after, he died of pneumonia contracted that stormy night.
