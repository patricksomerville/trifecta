# PyWrite Roadmap Planning System

A structured project planning system integrated with the PyWrite environment to improve code generation, autocomplete, and project organization.

## Overview

The PyWrite Roadmap Planning System helps you plan your coding projects before writing any code. It provides a structured approach to project planning with phases, requirements, components, and tasks. The system integrates with the autocomplete engine to provide context-aware suggestions based on your project plan.

## Features

- **Phase-based planning**: Organize your project into logical phases like Requirements, Design, Implementation, etc.
- **Requirement management**: Define functional and non-functional requirements for your project
- **Component architecture**: Design your application's components and their dependencies
- **Task tracking**: Break down work into manageable tasks with priorities and time estimates
- **Code generation**: Generate code scaffolding based on your project plan
- **Autocomplete integration**: Get code suggestions based on your project's components and architecture
- **Code analysis**: Analyze your code against your project plan to find inconsistencies

## Getting Started

### Running the Roadmap UI

To launch the roadmap planning UI:

```bash
./pywrite.sh roadmap
```

This will open a Streamlit-based interface where you can:
- Create new roadmaps
- Edit existing roadmaps
- Add phases, requirements, components, and tasks
- Generate code templates based on your roadmap

### Running the Roadmap Demo

To see a demonstration of the roadmap system:

```bash
./pywrite.sh roadmap-demo
```

This will:
1. Create a sample roadmap for a web application
2. Show how components are extracted from the roadmap
3. Demonstrate code suggestions based on the roadmap
4. Generate a simple component template
5. Analyze the generated code against the roadmap

## Integration with PyWrite

The roadmap system integrates with other PyWrite components:

- **Autocomplete Engine**: Get roadmap-aware code suggestions
- **Continuous Coding**: Generate code based on your project plan
- **Database**: Store and retrieve roadmaps

### Autocomplete Integration

When you have a roadmap loaded, the autocomplete system will suggest:
- Component classes based on your roadmap design
- Function signatures based on project requirements
- Proper dependencies between components

## Advanced Features

With an OpenAI API key set, the roadmap system can:
- Generate complete component implementations
- Suggest frameworks and libraries based on your project
- Analyze code and provide improvement suggestions
- Generate function implementations from requirements

## Files

- `project_roadmap.py`: Core classes for roadmap management
- `roadmap_ui.py`: Streamlit-based user interface
- `roadmap_autocomplete_bridge.py`: Integration with autocomplete system
- `roadmap_demo.py`: Demonstration of roadmap features

## Example Usage

### Creating a Roadmap

1. Launch the roadmap UI: `./pywrite.sh roadmap`
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Fill in project details and select project type
4. Add requirements, components, and tasks
5. Save your roadmap

### Generating Code

1. Go to the "Code Generation" tab
2. Select a template or component to generate
3. Click "Generate" to create the code
4. Save the generated code to your project

### Using Roadmap-Aware Autocomplete

When editing code, PyWrite will provide autocomplete suggestions based on your roadmap, for example:
- Suggesting component classes when you type `class `
- Providing implementation details based on component dependencies
- Suggesting function signatures from requirements

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL database (for persistent storage)
- Streamlit (for the UI)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for enhanced code generation)

## Enhancements

Future enhancements may include:
- Visual diagram generation
- Project timeline estimation
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with version control
- Export to popular project management tools
