Chapter 4 - "Old Behrman"

Sue descended the creaky stairs of the old brick building, her mind racing with thoughts of Johnsy and the ivy vine. The weight of her friend's despair pressed heavily upon her, and she knew she needed help to navigate this crisis. As she reached the landing of the floor below, Sue paused in front of a weathered door, hesitating for a moment before knocking firmly.

The door opened, revealing the grizzled face of Old Behrman, a man whose reputation as a talented but reclusive painter preceded him. His steely blue eyes met Sue's, and he grunted, "What do you want?"

"Mr. Behrman, I need your help," Sue pleaded, her voice trembling slightly. "It's my friend, Johnsy. She's very ill, and I don't know what to do."

Behrman's expression softened, and he stepped aside, motioning for Sue to enter. The apartment was dimly lit, the air heavy with the scent of turpentine and linseed oil. Canvases, both blank and filled with vibrant scenes, leaned against the walls, while tubes of paint and well-worn brushes littered every surface.

"Tell me what's troubling you," Behrman said, clearing a space on an old, paint-splattered sofa for Sue to sit.

As Sue recounted Johnsy's illness and her fixation on the ivy vine, Behrman listened intently, his brow furrowed in concentration. When she finished, he leaned back, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully.

"The mind can play tricks on us when we're ill," he mused. "Your friend, she's lost sight of what's important. She needs something to hold onto, something to remind her of the beauty and resilience of life."

Sue nodded, her eyes brimming with tears. "But what can I do, Mr. Behrman? How can I help her see that her life is worth fighting for?"

Behrman rose from his seat and crossed the room to a large, dusty window. He gazed out at the courtyard below, his eyes fixed on the ivy vine that had captured Johnsy's imagination. "Sometimes, Miss Sue, it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference. A gesture, a symbol, a reminder that hope is never truly lost."

He turned to face Sue, a glint of determination in his eye. "You must be strong for your friend, Miss Sue. Show her that you believe in her, that you won't give up on her. And trust that the universe has a way of providing what we need, even in our darkest hours."

Sue felt a surge of gratitude and relief wash over her. She stood, clasping Behrman's weathered hand in her own. "Thank you, Mr. Behrman. Your words mean more than you know."

As she made her way back to the apartment, Sue's mind raced with ideas. She would fill the studio with sketches and paintings of the ivy vine, capturing its beauty and resilience in every stroke. She would read to Johnsy, filling her mind with stories of hope and triumph. And she would remind her, every day, of the love and support that surrounded her.

With renewed determination, Sue climbed the stairs to the studio, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. She knew that, with Behrman's wisdom and her own unwavering faith, she would find a way to guide Johnsy back to the light.
