Chapter 7 - "Behrman's Secret"

As the days passed, the last leaf on the ivy vine remained steadfast, clinging to the brick wall with a tenacity that defied the harsh winds and icy rain. Johnsy, her eyes bright with a newfound hope, spent hours gazing at the leaf from her bed, drawing strength from its resilience. With each passing day, the color returned to her cheeks, and her breathing grew stronger.

Sue, ever the devoted friend, tended to Johnsy's needs, ensuring she was well-fed and comfortable. However, as Johnsy's health improved, Sue found herself increasingly curious about the leaf's miraculous survival. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story than met the eye.

One crisp autumn morning, Sue ventured downstairs to Old Behrman's apartment, determined to unravel the mystery. She knocked on the door, but no answer came. Worried, she tried the handle and found the door unlocked. Stepping inside, Sue was struck by the musty smell of oil paints and the chill that hung in the air.

"Behrman?" she called out, her voice echoing in the dim studio. As her eyes adjusted to the low light, she gasped at the sight before her. There, on an easel in the center of the room, stood a canvas bearing an exquisite, lifelike painting of the ivy vine, with a single, perfect leaf standing out against the bare branches.

Beside the easel, slumped in a chair, was Old Behrman, his brushes and palette scattered on the floor. Sue rushed to his side, her heart pounding as she realized the truth: Behrman had braved the storm to paint the last leaf, sacrificing his own health to give Johnsy the hope she needed to survive.

With trembling hands, Sue reached for the old artist's wrist, feeling for a pulse. It was there, faint but steady. Tears streamed down her face as she whispered, "Oh, Behrman, what have you done?"

Gently, she draped a blanket over the old man's shoulders and set about tidying the studio, her mind reeling from the revelation. As she worked, Sue marveled at the intricacy of Behrman's masterpiece, the way he had captured the delicate veins of the leaf and the rough texture of the brick wall. It was a testament to his skill and his love for his craft.

Hours later, as the sun began to set, Behrman stirred, his eyes fluttering open. Sue, who had been keeping vigil by his side, leaned in close. "Behrman, why did you do it?" she asked, her voice thick with emotion.

The old artist smiled weakly, his voice a hoarse whisper. "She needed to believe, child. Sometimes, the greatest gift we can give is hope."

Sue, overcome with gratitude, clasped Behrman's hand in her own. "You saved her life, Behrman. You saved both of us."

Behrman closed his eyes, a smile playing at the corners of his lips. "It was my masterpiece, Sue. The one I've been waiting my whole life to paint."

As the old artist drifted back to sleep, Sue sat in silence, marveling at the depth of his sacrifice and the power of his art. She knew that Johnsy would need to know the truth, to understand the magnitude of what Behrman had done for her. But for now, Sue simply basked in the warmth of the studio, the smell of the paints, and the knowledge that, in the face of adversity, true friendship and the love of art could conquer even the darkest of storms.
